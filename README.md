## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React]- JS library
- [Tailwaind]- CSS framework
- Node.js

### What I learned

 I learned to create a page with react and add my custom styles with tailwind, also I used react-router-dom to use links in my page. Too I used redux to share some data among my componets without neccesary to use useContext() from react.
 Finally I learned to created a little server with node for control routes in my page when you share a link to someone.
